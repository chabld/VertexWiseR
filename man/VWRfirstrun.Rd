\title{VertexWiseR system requirements installation}
\usage{
VWRfirstrun(requirement = "any")
}
\arguments{
\item{requirement}{String that specifies a requirement to enquire about (for specific brainstat libraries: 'fsaverage5', 'fsaverage6', 'yeo_parcels'). Default is 'any' requirement and checks everything.}
}
\description{
Helps the user install all system requirements for VertexWiseR functions to work (miniconda, brainstat toolbox and libraries). If they are installed already nothing will be overwritten.
}
\details{
VertexWiseR imports and makes use of the R package reticulate. reticulate is a package that allows R to borrow or translate python functions into R. Using reticulate, the package calls functions from the brainstat python module. For reticulate to work properly with VertexWiseR, the latest version of miniconda needs to be installed with it — miniconda is a lightweight version of python, specifically for use within RStudio. Likewise, analyses of cortical surface require fsaverage templates as imported by brainstat.
